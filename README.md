# QR Desktop App 🚀
*by @m7mdnas*

Hey there… yes, you 👀  
This little app is my personal QR code generator, made for me, but now it’s yours too if you want to play with it.  

I built it to **turn any link into a QR code** in seconds, right from my desktop. No web, no fuss. Just open, paste, choose a color, pick where to save it, and hit **GO**. Done.

- Supports **multiple languages** (English & Arabic)

1. Open the app (`qr_desktop_app.py`)  
2. Paste your URL  
3. Pick a color (because why not?)  
4. Choose a folder to save it  
5. Hit **GO** and enjoy your QR code

### Notes 📝
